#  MBTA Express Service Optimization: Revolutionizing Commuter Rail for Greater Boston

 **Region:** Greater Boston  
 **Tools Used:** Python (PuLP), Monte Carlo Simulation, Tableau, Jupyter, Excel  
 **Affiliation:** Northeastern University | Spring 2025  
 **Focus:** Transportation Optimization · Integer Programming · Revenue Forecasting · Simulation

##  Project Overview

This project proposes a data-driven express service model for the MBTA commuter rail that saves time, boosts ridership, and increases revenue—**without any infrastructure investment**. Our optimization model strategically identifies low-ridership stations to skip while preserving service equity, accessibility, and high-demand routes.

---

##  Key Questions Addressed

- How can we reduce travel time on commuter rail lines without disrupting major stations?
- What stations should be skipped to maximize overall passenger time saved?
- How do time savings translate to increased ridership and revenue?
- Can we deliver a high return on investment using only scheduling changes?

---

##  Methodology

###  Optimization Model

- **Objective:** Maximize total passenger time saved  
- **Constraints:**  
  - Preserve service at endpoints  
  - Avoid consecutive skipped stations  
  - Cap total skipped stations (≤40%)  
  - Protect high-ridership stops  
- **Tools:** Python, PuLP (Integer Programming)

###  Simulation & Forecasting

- **Monte Carlo Simulation:** 1,000 runs tested sensitivity of time, value, and equity assumptions  
- **Ridership Elasticity:** Applied 7% increase in ridership for every 10% time saved  
- **Revenue Projection:** $18.6M annual uplift based on adjusted fare model

##  Case Study: Greenbush Line

-  **Stations Skipped:** Nantasket Junction, Weymouth Landing, Quincy Center  
-  **Time Saved:** 7.5 minutes per trip (12.0%)  
-  **Riders Benefiting per Train:** 97  
-  **BCR:** 3.86 : 1  
-  **Student Impact:** Daily commuters save 60–120 hours/year (e.g., Northeastern grad students)
