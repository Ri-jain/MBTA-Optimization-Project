MBTA Express Service Optimization: Revolutionizing Commuter Rail for Greater Boston
📍 Region: Greater Boston
📊 Tools Used: Python (PuLP), Monte Carlo Simulation, Tableau, Jupyter, Excel
🏫 Affiliation: Northeastern University | Spring 2025
🧠 Focus: Transportation Optimization · Integer Programming · Revenue Forecasting · Simulation

🧠 Project Overview
This project proposes a data-driven express service model for the MBTA commuter rail that saves time, boosts ridership, and increases revenue—without any infrastructure investment. Our optimization model strategically identifies low-ridership stations to skip while preserving service equity, accessibility, and high-demand routes.

💡 Key Questions Addressed
How can we reduce travel time on commuter rail lines without disrupting major stations?

What stations should be skipped to maximize overall passenger time saved?

How do time savings translate to increased ridership and revenue?

Can we deliver a high return on investment using only scheduling changes?

🧮 Methodology
📐 Optimization Model
Objective: Maximize total passenger time saved

Constraints:

Preserve service at endpoints

Avoid consecutive skipped stations

Cap total skipped stations (≤40%)

Protect high-ridership stops

Tools: Python, PuLP (Integer Programming)

📊 Simulation & Forecasting
Monte Carlo Simulation: 1,000 runs tested sensitivity of time, value, and equity assumptions

Ridership Elasticity: Applied 7% increase in ridership for every 10% time saved

Revenue Projection: $18.6M annual uplift based on adjusted fare model

📈 Key Visualizations
⏱ Percentage of Trip Time Saved

💰 Benefit-to-Cost Ratio by Route

🔑 Key Outcomes
Metric	Result
Avg. Time Saved	9.25 minutes per trip
Projected Ridership Gain	+8.9% (10,000+ new daily riders)
Revenue Impact	+$18.6M annually
Avg. ROI (BCR)	4.2:1
Cars Removed from Roads	6,300 daily
Emissions Cut	9,400 tons CO₂ annually

📍 Case Study: Greenbush Line
🚉 Stations Skipped: Nantasket Junction, Weymouth Landing, Quincy Center

⏱ Time Saved: 7.5 minutes per trip (12.0%)

👥 Riders Benefiting per Train: 97

📊 BCR: 3.86 : 1

💡 Student Impact: Daily commuters save 60–120 hours/year (e.g., Northeastern grad students)
